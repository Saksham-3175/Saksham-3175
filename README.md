# Hey there 👋, I’m Saksham Shukla (aka AI Generalist)

## Learning by Building | Prototyping AI Agents & Workflows | Future-Focused

I’m an undergrad and aspiring AI/ML engineer who believes the best way to learn is to ship. I prototype GenAI-powered automations, plug them into real workflows, and share the wins (and fails) in public.

### 🔧 Current Prototypes
Coming Soon!!!

### 📚 Current Learning Focus

- **Tech**  
  - LangChain (Agents, chains, retrievers)  
  - APIs & fine‑tuning  
  - SQL DBs: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Supabase, DuckDB
  - NoSQL: MongoDB, Firebase Firestore, Redis, Cassandra, DynamoDB
  - Vector DBs: Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate
  - MLOps: Prefect, Dagster, MLflow basics  
  - Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI  
  - No‑code/low‑code: n8n, Make.com, Zapier  
  - Frontend glue: React, Next.js, simple Dash/UIs
  - Classic ML: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, SHAP, Optuna

- **Process**  
  - Rapid prototyping & iteration (MVP mindset)  
  - Prompt engineering & prompt‑chaining best practices  
  - CI/CD for ML: tests, linting, model versioning  
  - Notion‑driven project management & public roadmaps  
  - Client discovery: workflow audits, ROI scoping  
  - Productization: templating, packaging micro‑offers  
  - Outreach cadence: “build‑in‑public” + community feedback loops  

- **Non‑Tech**  
  - Storytelling & data storytelling frameworks  
  - Product management essentials (lean canvas, user journeys)  
  - Freelance fundamentals: pricing, contracts, invoicing  
  - Personal branding: content calendars, “build in public” rituals  
  - Time & energy management: time‑boxing, sleep hygiene, recovery rituals  

### 💡 Operating Beliefs
- **Build Fast, Learn Fast**: code first, optimize later  
- **Share Everything**: transparency attracts the right opportunities  
- **Value = Revenue**: focus on hard ROI, not vanity features
